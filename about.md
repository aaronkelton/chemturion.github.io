I'm Aaron, or "Ay-Ay-Ron" thanks to Key & Peele's [Substitute Teacher](https://youtu.be/Dd7FixvoKBw) skit. My last boss's last text to me was, "Were you wearing tennis shoes during the meeting?" An independent at heart, I transitioned to entrepreneurship in early 2016. Launched and crashed a startup which lead me to becoming a Ruby on Rails developer. As I continually mine deeper into Ruby and Rails, my lifeline to users at the surface is React.
