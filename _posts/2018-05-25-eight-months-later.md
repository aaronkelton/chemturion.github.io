Wow, time travels when you're having fun! Launch startup; crash startup; learn
Ruby; get real experience using Ruby! I thought it was time to reflect on my
past eight months as a software maker, but first here's some background.

### Background

I didn't "switch careers" from the non-technical to the technical. I had already rewired
my brain studying chemical engineering and writing scripts in MATLAB to solve
tricky problems. Because, y'know.. math is hard üòè. I became best friends with
Edgar Codd shortly after college, and our relationship was, well.. normalized.
Wrapping my mind around object-orientation was a challenge having grown up in a
procedural household, but moving to a big city will enlighten even the most
rural of hillbillies. In my brief stint on this earth, I've learned that the
thing I enjoy doing most is learning itself. And the ecosystem that is software
development lends itself beautifully to this addiction. I'm pleased to be here,
but I won't be "here" for long, and it's precisely this progressive purview that I love
about what I do.

### What I've Done

#### vim

> vim - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor

I once taught myself the Dvorak keyboard layout and used it for about two years.
Doing so gave me the experience needed to pick up Vim, which my current team
uses. However, I've switched back to a QWERTY layout. There's a real benefit of
having familiarity amongst a team. Keeping one-off modifications to a minimum
means we can view and use each other's keyboard and terminal with ease. When I
started, my team was using the Homebrew theme, which was terrible, so I
convinced us to switch to
[Flat](https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes#flat).

I've even taken Vim so far as using it in my browser with the [Vimium Chrome extension](https://youtu.be/t67Sn0RGK54)!

The next step I need to take with Vim is thoroughly going thru the [Udemy class](https://www.udemy.com/vim-commands-cheat-sheet/learn/v4/overview) I purchased but haven't gotten around to, and [learning tmux](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/tmux). Someday I'll even get around to Emacs, but mostly for heretical reasons. üòá

#### Test Driven Development

Disclaimer: I don't always test first, but when I do‚Äî¬†I prefer `build_stubbed`.

I hate starting a server, opening my browser, waiting for pages to load, and
finally dissecting an error. Sometimes you gotta smoke test, but for most cases,
I much prefer writing tests. I've become relatively proficient with RSpec,
Factory Bot, and Capybara. In fact, my first professional commit was a few lines in a controller
followed by a 50-line feature test. Not bad!

When I was learning Ruby, testing wasn't top of mind. And I agree with this
approach. Eventually you have to learn how to write automated tests,
especially if you're lazy (it does the work for you, over and over).

I've introduced SimpleCov for test coverage.

#### Git

I love Git, even though on my very first day I force pushed to master sans pull
request. When you're new, sometimes you gotta just press keys and clean up your
mistakes afterward ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It helps expose workflow and repository vulnerabilities at the very least.

I've studied a lot of Git because it's ubiquitous and I've learned that not a
lot of developers *actually* understand what the hell is actually going on. I've
also taught a couple classes at Dallas Makerspace on Git itself, and using Git
while learning Ruby. Teaching reinforces my own understanding, and I genuinely
enjoy helping others turn on their lightbulbs.

#### Mentor

I've had a great mentor in my manager and team lead. He's a big fan of "Uncle
Bob" Robert Martin, and evangelizes the gospel sensibly.

#### Wholesale Rails Improvements

updated Ruby
Rails upgrade branch
update_attributes become update()
polymorphic join table - configs?
implemented contact support feature



I need to clean up my Jekyll posting process, because I have to break into the repo and duplicate a file, then change some meta data and content before publishing. I like that I own the site, but the publishing process could be improved. Anyway, I got hired as a Software Engineer doing Ruby on Rails in early October 2017, so I've been at it a little over four measly months. I'd like to tell you more about it, but I'll start by saying I'm really trying to understand Git and GitHub, so I started teaching a class at Dallas Makerspace. When I ordered [stickers from GitHub](https://github.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/octodex-sticker-packs), I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting, so in an effort to help others who also won't know, here you go:
