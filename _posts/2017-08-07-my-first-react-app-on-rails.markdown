Late last week I discovered a great blog post on [building a quick app using Rails 5.1, webpacker, and React](https://x-team.com/blog/get-in-full-stack-shape-with-rails-5-1-webpacker-and-reactjs/). So I went through it and published my [code on GitHub](https://github.com/chemturion/react-quotes), and the [full app is on Heroku](https://chemturion-quotes-react.herokuapp.com/). I highly recommend going thru this tutorial!
