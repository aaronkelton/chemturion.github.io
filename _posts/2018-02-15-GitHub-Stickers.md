I need to clean up my Jekyll posting process, because I have to break into the repo and duplicate a file, then change some meta data and content before publishing. I like that I own the site, but the publishing process could be improved. Anyway, I got hired as a Software Engineer doing Ruby on Rails in early October 2017, so I've been at it a little over four measly months. I'd like to tell you more about it, but I'll start by saying I'm really trying to understand Git and GitHub, so I started teaching a class at Dallas Makerspace. When I ordered [stickers from GitHub](https://github.myshopify.com/collections/all-products/products/octodex-sticker-packs), I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting, so in an effort to help others who also won't know, here you go:
